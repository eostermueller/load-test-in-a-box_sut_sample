perfKey.message: Performance Key
perfKey.description.01: You get to choose!  There are two ways to make 'live' changes to littleMock's performance.
perfKey.description.02: Change this 'performanceKey' (and click Update) to change all settings at once. This is helpful when someone asks you to try a particular configuration.  The default perfKey ('X0,J100,K100,L0,Q0,S0,A0,B1024,C0,D60000') is always applied first, then the key below overrides that.  That way, if you forget to include one code (like B something, B24 or B2525), the default B value of B1024 will be used.
perfKey.description.03: Or, you can use the rest of this page to change individual settings.  See the square brackets [ ] towards the left of each item below? EX: [X1] and [B].  You can use the letter(s) in the square brackets in the above performanceKey.  EX:  X1 means 'Avoid DOM parsing by caching it for repeat input'.  B1024 in the perfKey means use 1024 as the upper bound for allocation of random size(bytes) -- see [B] below.

xslt.impl.00: No xslt activity at all.
xslt.impl.01: Reread and reparse xslt files for every transform, even though they don't change at runtime.
xslt.impl.02: Store parsed xslt files in a pool.
 
xpath.message: XPath Optimizations
xslt.message: XSLT Optimizations
other.message: Other Optimizations
busy.message: Busy Processing Optimizations
old.gen.message: Extra Garbage Creation
busy.description: Increase #'s for more processing (aka less performance):
old.gen.description: Create garbage or perhaps or out-of-memory condition.
busy.update: Update
busy.sleep: Sleep time.  ( time in milliseconds to java.lang.Thread.sleep() )
code.link: (source link)

update.a.description: 0=disabled.  Check for and remove expired garbage every N servlet requests.  Larger N means more old gen garbage.    
update.b.description: byte counts are randomly allocated, this is the upper bound
update.c.description: bytes are retained for a random duration, this is the lower bound (milliseconds).  Longer duration means more old gen garbage.
update.d.description: bytes are retained for a random duration, this is the upper bound (milliseconds).  Longer duration means more old gen garbage.
clear.old.gen.description: Call the .clear() method on the singleton/map with old gen data.
